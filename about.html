                    <p>I'm Diane Peterson and I believe that the organizations making the most difference in our
                        community deserve the
                        highest quality support. My journey to founding Anacortes Nonprofit Navigator has been a
                        25-year path of combining technical expertise with a passion for local service.</p>

                        <h3>Background & Experience</h3>
                        <p>With a B.S. in Computer Science and an MBA, I spent the early part of my career as a
                            consultant building complex systems for corporations. This phase of my life taught me the
                            power of robust infrastructure and the efficiency that comes from well-designed technology.
                            It also taught me every client is unique, and the best solution is the one that fits their
                            specific needs and constraints.
                        </p>
                        <p>After shifting my focus to raising my family and volunteering locally, I returned to the
                            professional world with a new mission: serving the organizations that hold our community
                            together.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="subsection">
                        <h3>Community Involvement</h3>
                        <p>Aside from volunteering, my recent employment in the nonprofit sector includes:</p>
                        <p><span class="org-name">Fidalgo DanceWorks:</span> For six years, I managed the administrative
                            and
                            operational side of FDW. Working alongside a talented team of dance teachers and directors,
                            I managed the ins and
                            outs of the business: running everything from IT and CRM management to bookkeeping and
                            events.</p>
                        <p><span class="org-name">Skagit Community Foundation:</span> My time at SCF gave me a broader
                            perspective
                            on our local nonprofit landscape. Many dedicated leaders stuggle with operations not because
                            they lack vision,
                            but because they lack time, budget, or specialized expertise.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="subsection">
                        <h3>Approach & Philosophy</h3>
                        <p>I'm not just a consultant—I'm your partner. There's no one-size-fits-all solution. Every
                            organization has unique constraints in budget, staff capacity, and existing infrastucture.
                            I thrive on the challenge of finding practical solutions that work within each
                            organization's reality.
                            We'll work together to find what fits your needs now and into the future.</p>
                        <p>My greatest satisfaction comes from when the systems I build take the "tech stress" off your
                            plate, so you can focus on serving our community.
                        </p>
