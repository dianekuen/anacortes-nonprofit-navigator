                    <p>I believe that the organizations making the most difference in our community deserve the
                        highest quality support. My journey to founding Anacortes Nonprofit Navigator has been a
                        20-year path of combining technical expertise with a passion for local service.</p>

                        <h3>Background & Experience</h3>
                        <p>With a Computer Science degree and an MBA, I spent the early part of my career as a
                            consultant building complex systems for corporations. This phase of my life taught me the
                            power of robust infrastructure and the efficiency that comes from well-designed technology.
                        </p>
                        <p>After shifting my focus to raising my family and volunteering locally, I returned to the
                            professional world with a new mission: serving the organizations that hold our community
                            together.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="subsection">
                        <h3>Community Involvement</h3>
                        <p><span class="org-name">Fidalgo DanceWorks:</span> I managed all administrative and
                            operational systems for this
                            local arts organization, building their infrastructure from the ground up—from IT and CRM to
                            bookkeeping and events.</p>
                        <p><span class="org-name">Skagit Community Foundation:</span> My time here gave me insight into
                            our nonprofit landscape. I saw
                            firsthand that many dedicated leaders struggle with operations not because they lack vision,
                            but because they lack time, budget, or specialized expertise.</p>

                    <div class="subsection">
                        <h3>Approach & Philosophy</h3>
                        <p>I'm not just a consultant—I'm your partner. There's no one-size-fits-all solution. Every
                            organization works within constraints: budget, staff, existing systems. We'll work together
                            to find what fits your needs now and into the future.</p>
                        <p>I understand that in small nonprofits, you're wearing many hats at once. My goal is to take
                            the "tech stress" off your plate, creating sustainable systems that let you focus on your
                            mission.
