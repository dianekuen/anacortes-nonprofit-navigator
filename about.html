                        <p>My journey to founding Anacortes Nonprofit Navigator has been a
                            25-year path of combining technical expertise with a passion for local service.</p>

                        <h3>Background & Experience</h3>
                        <p>With a B.S. in Computer Science and an MBA, I spent the early part of my career as a
                            consultant building complex systems for corporations such as McNeil Pharmaceuticals, Major
                            League Baseball, and Hewitt Associates. This phase of my life taught me the
                            power of robust infrastructure and the efficiency that comes from well-designed technology.
                            It also taught me every client is unique, and the best solution is the one that fits their
                            specific needs and constraints.
                        </p>
                        <p>After shifting my focus to raising my family and volunteering locally, I returned to the
                            professional world with a new mission: serving the organizations that hold our community
                            together.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="subsection">
                        <h3>Community Involvement</h3>
                        <p>Aside from volunteering, my recent employment in the nonprofit sector includes:</p>
                        <p><span class="org-name">Fidalgo DanceWorks:</span> For six years, I managed the administrative
                            and operational side of FDW. Working alongside a talented team of dance teachers,
                            I managed the ins and
                            outs of the business: running everything from IT and CRM management to bookkeeping and
                            events.</p>
                        <p><span class="org-name">Skagit Community Foundation:</span> My time at SCF gave me a broader
                            perspective
                            on our local nonprofit landscape. Many dedicated leaders struggle with operations not
                            because
                            they lack vision,
                            but because they lack time, budget, or specialized expertise.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="subsection">
                        <h3>Approach & Philosophy</h3>
                        <p>After seeing the struggles of nonprofit leaders, I realized I could serve my community best
                            by
                            offering my expertise to those who need it most. Thus, Anacortes Nonprofit Navigator was
                            born.</p>
                        <p>
                            I don't see myself as a consultant but rather a partner. Every
                            organization has unique constraints in budget, staff capacity, and existing infrastucture.
                            I thrive on the challenge of finding practical solutions that work within each
                            organization's reality.
                        </p>
                        <p>My greatest satisfaction comes from when the systems I build free organizations to focus on
                            their mission and the people their serve.
                        </p>
