                        <h3>The Silent Drain</h3>
                        <p>Nonprofit leaders are the most resourceful people I know. Always doing more with less. Always
                            looking for ways to stretch the dollar. However, it is easy to fall into the trap of
                            pinching pennies during budgeting season while invisible subscription fees drain your impact
                            every month. Sometimes you are paying for things that are not even being used, or paying for
                            two separate licenses when one would suffice. At least once a year, just like the financial
                            reviews we all know are so important, a technology audit should be done to protect your
                            organization from both financial drain and security vulnerabilities.</p>

                        <h3>Where the Leaks Hide</h3>
                        <h4>Inherited Systems</h4>
                        <p>
                            New leaders often inherit ‘ghost’ systems. Because auto-renewing subscriptions are often too
                            small to trigger a red flag on a credit card statement, they are paid without anyone
                            questioning their necessity.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Unchecked Upgrades</h4>
                        <p>
                            Software providers can change their pricing tiers, and while they may send an email about
                            it, that notice is easy to miss. Maybe it got buried among spam-looking emails; maybe it
                            went to an inbox no longer monitored. Now the subscription leveled up without review and you
                            are paying for extra features when the lower tier is what you need.
                        </p>
                        <p>Sometimes we do need the upgrade when we go over our limit, such as a large number of
                            transactions at a peak time. The problem is that once the peak passes, we often forget to
                            downgrade. The same is true for free trials that require a credit card upfront and you must
                            remember to cancel.</p>
                        <h4>Ghost Users</h4>

                        <p>Some subscriptions charge by user and you still have a former staff member or
                            volunteer listed as a user. You are not only paying for their unused license, but
                            potentially creating a security vulnerability.
                        </p>
                        <p>Nonprofit leaders, while the most resourceful, are also the busiest people I know. It
                            is easy to have all these tasks fall through the cracks because they are admin work that is
                            lower priority than the mission. But those fees add up when unmanaged. Not to mention the
                            security implications of giving access to people who are no longer with your organization.
                        </p>
                        <h4>The Microsoft Shift</h4>
                        <p>
                            Many nonprofits have been using Microsoft for free. Recently, they adjusted their
                            grant structure. When your annual license expires, you will shift to a discounted per user
                            model. That cost multiplies quickly if your user list isn’t intentionally managed. When it
                            was free, perhaps you created accounts for all your board members and volunteers to share
                            documents in Teams. Similarly, you didn’t remove the license from staff members who have
                            moved on. Now even at $5 per user, that could multiply and create a monthly subscription fee
                            you had not budgeted.
                        </p>
                        <h3>The Tech Audit: A Strategic Must</h3>

                        <p>Now that you know where the leaks are, you need a structured audit to close them. A
                            technology audit should be as routine as your annual budget review. Some technology
                            decisions are intentional; others are not. An audit brings those issues to the forefront for
                            leaders to address. The technologies you choose, when aligned with the strategic vision of
                            the organization, create the infrastructure that will enhance your growth.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Financial Benefits</h4>
                        <p>
                            When you ‘set it and forget it’, you are potentially paying for subscriptions you no longer
                            need. Compiling a list of your technologies will reveal if you are paying for duplicate
                            services
                            such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams. Many software platforms offer different tiers and those
                            offerings may have changed since you first subscribed. Check if you are paying for a higher
                            tier
                            than you need. Perhaps a team package could save you on licensing fees and unlock team
                            management features now that your organization has grown. Always ask if there is a nonprofit
                            discount, especially for the platforms you already use. And of course, cancel those that no
                            one
                            is using.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Security Benefits</h4>
                        <p>

                            Have you ever added a volunteer to the account or shared a password to someone to help with
                            something and never went back to remove their access? A tech audit reveals who is on
                            what account. Staff and board members who have left the organization but still hold licenses
                            are both a financial and a legal liability. Review user access to ensure the right people
                            have
                            proper permissions on your systems. If data integrity and accountability are very important
                            to you, make sure the platform you choose can handle that and you are using its features to
                            manage access properly for auditability.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Operational Benefits</h4>
                        <p>

                            So far the focus has been on saving money and plugging security holes, but another benefit
                            of the tech audit is gaining operational efficiency. If you are using two tools to do one
                            job, that creates administrative overhead. While an audit reveals if your organization is
                            paying for unused features, it is also an opportunity to see what new features are offered
                            that could improve your workflow. As your organization grows, the systems that support it
                            need to evolve as well. Assessing the existing technology to ensure it can support
                            future growth is another important reason to do the audit.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Best Practices</h3>
                        <p>Fortunately, many of the tools needed are available to nonprofits at a fraction of the
                            commercial cost.
                        </p>
                        <p>Sign up with TechSoup. They have both software and hardware discounts. Once TechSoup verifies
                            your nonprofit status, their certification unlocks discounts with many vendors. Read the
                            fine print. Some deals require a minimum number of licenses that, when bundled, may cost
                            more than you need to spend. One good deal is Quickbooks, free for 5 users with an annual
                            admin fee of $80 to TechSoup.
                        </p>
                        <p>Reach out to companies and ask if they offer nonprofit discounts. But do your research. Not
                            everything free is a good fit. Look into the company and the service it provides. Stay with
                            trusted ones that are supporting philanthropy. Make an intentional decision rather than
                            being lured in by a sales pitch.
                        </p>
