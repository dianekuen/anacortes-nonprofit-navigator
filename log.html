                        <h3>The Shifting Donor Landscape</h3>
                        <p>Last year I went to <a href="https://afpglobal.org/afp-icon/past-conferences">AFP ICON
                                2025</a> in Seattle and
                            one of the
                            biggest takeaways was that the donor pyramid is looking more like an Eiffel tower than the
                            pyramid. A small number of donors are doing all the heavy lifting, putting in billions of
                            dollars into philanthropic causes. Meanwhile, the everyday donors are fewer and giving less.
                            What does this tell us as fundraisers? We are not tapping into those smaller donors and will
                            become too dependent on 1-2 major donors to run our organization. When that donor’s funding
                            ends, you will be left with a big gap to fill.</p>

                        <h3>Diversifying Risk</h3>
                        <p>How do we diversify this risk? The answer is to engage the everyday donor in your mission.
                            The way
                            to do that is easier than you think. They are already participating in your organization in
                            some
                            fashion. Identifying them and stewarding that relationship is the task at hand. We are
                            talking
                            about the volunteers, the board members, the spouse that gave from their DAF, and the
                            business owner
                            that sponsored your event. These are all transactions that may not be captured and
                            contributed to
                            the correct individual. Or they are captured but on a variety of platforms.</p>

                        <h3>The Challenge of Tech Chaos</h3>
                        <p>This article <a
                                href="https://www.philanthropy.com/news/taming-tech-chaos-in-the-back-office/?_hsenc=p2ANqtz--eMuK0Qitrp7ZkiQWlYat4p1SbcbFnzpvcmy-8Tt5KBRYa1NWHomk4hTzj7L8sWxpxfQ9rQYm7-MAgKLL4z_OMFfqO1Q&_hsmi=398920408">Taming
                                Tech Chaos in the Back Office</a> is spot on in regards to the plethora of platforms
                            created to
                            make it easier for donors to give but creates chaos for the nonprofit back office to sort
                            through
                            the data. Online donations via QR codes makes it so easy for the donor. It captures the
                            donor name
                            (auto-filled), and credit card info (from the payment app) and the money gets deposited to
                            your
                            bank. Now you are figuring out who that person is and entering them manually into your main
                            database. A slightly more thoughtful approach might include an import/export functionality
                            that
                            gets the information from one system to the other. Nonetheless, back office manual entry is
                            unavoidable. How about the ACH payment from a financial institution? Are you spending the
                            time to
                            track down the donor who initiated that transaction?</p>
                        <p>The article does not provide a solution, rather it hopes more technology will solve the
                            problem
                            eventually. And everyday, more technology is being built and targeted to nonprofit leaders!
                            There
                            are so many ‘solutions’ out there that create integrations between the various platforms and
                            now we
                            are filtering through them only to find ourselves with more technology. How do we tackle
                            this
                            problem when all we want to do is serve our mission and the causes that are so dear to our
                            hearts?
                        </p>
                        <h3>Relationships, Not Apps</h3>
                        <p>The answer is not more apps. Donor stewardship is about relationships and all the technology
                            in the
                            world cannot build those relationships. People build relationships. Technology, however, can
                            capture data, analyze it, create reports, and even make predictions so we can focus on the
                            human
                            work of relationship building.</p>

                        <p>One of the challenges in the nonprofit sector is high staff turnover. People in this field
                            are
                            passionate, but often overworked and underpaid. How can you steward a relationship when the
                            people
                            keep changing? Choosing a technology solution that fits your needs and creating clear
                            processes to
                            ensure data integrity is a good place to start.</p>
                        <h3>Building Resilient Infrastructure</h3>
                        <p>Data is king! But it is also a case of garbage in, garbage out. Knowing which information
                            matters and
                            ensuring it is captured correctly helps protect relationships during staff transition. When
                            the
                            development director leaves, the donor relationship doesn’t have to leave with them. A good
                            system
                            captures historical context so the next nonprofit leader can continue the relationship with
                            an
                            understanding of past conversations. A good system also aggregates the information so you
                            understand the individual as a whole. It can identify that recurring donor giving to your
                            cause over
                            the course of 10 years. Maybe only $50 each time but that consistency shows loyalty.
                            Recognizing and
                            celebrating that relationship is stewardship. </p>
                        <p>Infrastructure matters. Picking a system that fits the organizational needs and will actually
                            be used
                            by staff and volunteers is key. With good data, you can analyze the reports to craft the
                            ‘ask’,
                            create meaningful touch points, and engage those everyday ‘donors’ at their level. That
                            consistent
                            volunteer may become your next big donor. Are you capturing that data and stewarding that
                            relationship? Do you have the infrastructure in place to easily onboard new staff/volunteers
                            to
                            help with fundraising? Are you using the right tools for the purposes they are designed for?
                        </p>
                        <h3>Take Action!</h3>
                        <p>Review how you track the data on people who care about your mission, not just those who give
                            money,
                            but those who give their time, expertise, and advocacy. Streamlining these processes to
                            ensure the
                            integrity of your data is an investment that strengthens donor relationships while
                            mitigating the
                            loss of institutional knowledge during staff turnover.</p>
